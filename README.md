After completing the CSS Foundations Course I've completed the Flexbox course.

## FLexbox
- **Introduction to Flexbox**
  - Learned how to position elements using flexbox.
  - Learned about flex containers and flex items.
  - Learned how to create useful components and layouts that go beyond just stacking and centering items.

- **Growing and Shrinking**
  - Learned about the 3 properties that are defined by the flex shorthand, and how to use them individually.

- **Axes**
  - Learned about the 2 “axes” of a flex container.
  - Learned how to change those axes to arrange your content in columns instead of rows.

- **Alignment**
  - Learned how to align items inside a flex container both vertically and horizontally.

- **Project: Landing Page**
  - This is the a project where I used the above Flexbox concepts to style the html with my previous CSS knowledge
